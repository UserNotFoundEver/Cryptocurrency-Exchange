# cryptocurrency exchange with Python / Django
Working on this cryptocurrency exchange django application. You'll have the ability to switch between coins by selecting your current coin, and the one you wish to obtain. After including your return address, new address (for the coin you want to switch for), you'll simply deposit to an address or scan a QR code using a wallet app, and within minutes you'll automatically get the other coin.

# API
Currently using the Changelly API.

# to do
It is currently an early work in progress. All it does it getCoins, which lists all the available coins available for exchange.

# programming languages and frameworks needed
Python, JavaScript/Ajax, and Django (and obviously HTML/CSS).

# support
You can get an API key on changelly, ahotuhg there is so much tech in 2024 that I would advice to DYOR. This exchange isn't a finished product. Proceed with caution and make sure you know what you are doing. 100000% this python code needs to be updated etc.
