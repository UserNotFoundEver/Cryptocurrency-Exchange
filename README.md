# cryptocurrency exchange with Python / Django
Working on this cryptocurrency exchange django application. You'll have the ability to switch between coins by selecting your current coin, and the one you wish to obtain. After including your return address, new address (for the coin you want to switch for), you'll simply deposit to an address or scan a QR code using a wallet app, and within minutes you'll automatically get the other coin.

# API
Currently using the Changelly API.

# to do
It is currently an early work in progress. All it does it getCoins, which lists all the available coins available for exchange.

# programming languages and frameworks needed
Python, JavaScript/Ajax, and Django (and obviously HTML/CSS).

# support
You can get an API key by signing up with my affiliate link. I'll get a tiny percentage of a transaction for every time you try Changelly, even if it's for testing purposes to decide if you like the service/API. https://changelly.com/?ref_id=32fb1c808f3c

You can also purchase Cryptocurrency on Coinbase https://www.coinbase.com/join/5961d3bad26ede011ecc6fa7 . It's possible to buy Bitcoin, and use the app to scan the QR code and receive Ethereum for example, since the App supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin wallets. However, you can use any wallet you want.
